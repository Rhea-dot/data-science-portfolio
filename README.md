# data-science-portfolio

Welcome!
This repository is a personal collection of self-contained projects and exercises in data science, with a focus on machine learning, simulation, and data analysis. 

## About Me

A brief introduction: 
- **Person:** My name is Rhea and I am currently studying Technical Physics at the University of Applied Sciences in Munich. <br>
- **Tools & languages:** Python, Numpy, Matplotlib<br>
- **Motivation:** I want to explore different fields and find out where I see myself professionally in the future. As a physics student who has always enjoyed working with numbers and mathematics, I see great potential in data science as a way to combine both of these passions.
